## Method

1. Use Linear Regression to find the variables that can predict MPG
2. Build a prediction model using those variables
3. Create a shiny app that enables users to input those variables in order to predict MPG
4. Include the mtcars table so that users can compare their result to the real data
```{r }
sort(cor(mtcars)[1,])
```

This correlation shows that wt, hp, am, cyl and disp are all highly correlated with mpg

--- .class #id 

## Eliminate Variables Highly correlated with Each Other
```{r }
sort(cor(mtcars)[4,])
```

We can eliminate hp and disp since predictors should not be highly correlated with each other

--- .class #id

## Build the Model Using Weight, Horsepower and Transmission Type

```{r }
pred <- lm(mpg ~ am + wt + hp, data = mtcars)
summary(pred)$coef
```

--- .class #id

## Plots

```{r }
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(pred)
```

--- .class #id

## Conclusion

```{r }
summary(pred)$r.squared
```

* This model explains ~84% of the variance
* This shows that the combination of weight, horsepower and transmission type is a good predictor of mpg
